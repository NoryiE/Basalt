Frame is a subclass of the Container class and inherits from VisualObject and Object classes. Frame objects are used for grouping and organizing other objects within a parent object, providing structure to your interface. The main difference between Frame and BaseFrame is that Frame must always have a parent.

In addition to the methods inherited from Container, VisualObject and Object, Frame has the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[getOffset](objects/BaseFrame/getOffset.md)|Returns the current offset of the BaseFrame object
|[setOffset](objects/BaseFrame/setOffset.md)|Sets a new offset for the BaseFrame object
