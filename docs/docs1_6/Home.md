# Welcome to The old Basalt Wiki!

This Basalt Wiki is outdated!

*Note: The Basalt Wiki is a work in progress. Please treat Wiki errors the same as bugs and report them accordingly.*

Here you can find information about how to use Basalt as well as examples of functional Basalt code. The aim of Basalt is to improve user interaction through visual display.
